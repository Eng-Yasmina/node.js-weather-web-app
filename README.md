# node.js-weather-web-app
Using the solution of fetch and modern promises, i developed an async js web app that uses web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for this feel.weather web app.



***Steps of how I have developed this Web app:***
1. I set up the server and route data through my app (check out server.js file).
2. I sent (GET request) to Open Weather Map to receive the weather data by integrating it's API into my app and fetching the data using [zip code] and my [API key].
3. I sent (POST request) to the server to store the received data in my app's backend (server.js).
4. I sent (GET request) to the server to retrieve the stored data from the server and dynamically update the UI of my app.
# Scripts
